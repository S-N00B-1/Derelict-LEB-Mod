# Example LEB Mod

Example LEB-ModTools repository, it has a example map inside it as well if you want to just test out the compiler

If you're actually making a map, you should replace the example map with yours

For information on how to actually use this repository, please see the [LEB-ModTools documentation](https://github.com/DBTDerpbox/LEB-ModTools/wiki)
